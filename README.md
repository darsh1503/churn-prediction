Customer churn is a serious threat to profitability in the telecom sector. Accuracy in traditional churn prediction methods is frequently lacking. Our project's goal is to create a predictive model that can recognize clients who are likely to leave based on their usage habits, demographics, and service-related information by utilizing machine learning algorithms. This will make it possible for telecom firms to put targeted retention strategies into place, which will ultimately lower churn rates and boost overall company performance.
